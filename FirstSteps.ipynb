    "- Standalone IJulia kernel can be installed using the command `Pkg.add(\"IJulia\")` on the kernel\n",
    "- However, this creates a local copy of Miniconda and installs `Jupyter` on the local Miniconda installation.\n",
    "- To overcome this \"problem\":\n",
    "  - First create the environment variable `JUPYTER` and add the path of `Jupyter` to it\n",
    "    > `JUPYTER=\"<path-to-anaconda-scripts>\\jupyter\"` or use Windows environment variables to add `JUPYTER` \n",
    "  - Add `jupyter` to path, so that it is 'findable' by Julia\n",
    "    > `export PATH=$PATH:<path-to-jupyter>` or use Windows environment variables to set the path\n",
    "  - Next, open the Julia REPL and type:\n",
    "    > `ENV[\"JUPYTER\"]=\"jupyter\"; Pkg.add(\"IJulia\")` \n",

    "- The traditional way is to open the Julia REPL and type the following:\n",

    "- Problems:\n",
    "  1. It doesn't open `jupyter` in the folder you want it to open; always home folder is selected (I HATE THIS)\n",
    "  2. To close you need to first select `File -> Close and Halt` in the browser/notebook\n",
    "     - Then proceed to the REPL to press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>\n",
    "     - This can get messy, as many times <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> on the REPL is non-responsive\n",
    "\n",
    "- My (hack-ish) solution to the above problems:\n",
    "  1. Open the command prompt/terminal/Anaconda prompt and `cd` to the folder of choice\n",
    "  2. Open `jupyter` by typing `jupyter` in the command prompt \n",
    "     - This opens up `Jupyter`\n",
    "  3. Create a new Julia kernel using `New` on the notebook, or\n",
    "  4. Open an existing `ipynb` notebook file <br> <br>\n",
